# Google Play Strore Apps Clustering, Analysis and Recommendation
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Recommendation system

# Problem Statement:
The Google Play Store is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on the Android operating system and its derivatives as well as Chrome OS, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, books, movies, magzines and television programs. 

Android is an operating system expanding throughout the years. It has aquired 71.93%, highest market share worldwide on mobile devices which is a true indicator of the huge amount of population using android. Our goal is to help and recommend the android developers to know what are the motivating factors for people to download an app. It will also help to find out the factors that affect someoneâ€™s decision to download an app. We would like to analyse category, reviews, price, ratings and installs for this purpose and find out how they are inter related and help in recommending the app's.

# Techniques used:
1. Done necessary exploaratory data analysis and feature engineering on the dataset. 
2. Applied Unsupervised machine learning techniques like K-Means, Agglomerative, DBScan techniques for clustering the apps based several factors 
3. Used recommendation systems to recommend the apps to the users based on the popularity and content of the apps.
